# Why I worked on this project

This project allowed me to discover the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) framework, [Prisma](https://prisma.io) and WebSockets via [Socket.io](https://socket.io)

_Disclamer: This project was my work for [Polygon](https://hellopolygon.com)'s technical assignment as part of their recruitment process_
